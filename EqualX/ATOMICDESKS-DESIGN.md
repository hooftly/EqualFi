# EqualX Atomic Desks Design Document

**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview

Atomic Desks enable trustless cross-chain atomic swaps between EVM-based assets (ETH, ERC-20 tokens) and Monero (XMR). The system uses CLSAG adaptor signatures to cryptographically bind transactions on both chains, ensuring atomicity without requiring trusted intermediaries.

### 1.1 Design Goals

- **Atomicity**: Either both legs of the swap complete, or neither does
- **Privacy**: Monero transaction details remain private through ring signatures
- **Trustlessness**: No trusted third parties required for successful swaps
- **Collateralization**: All EVM-side assets are fully collateralized in DeskVault
- **Settlement Authority**: Only authorized parties (desk makers or committee) can settle swaps

### 1.2 Key Components

1. **AtomicDesk**: Main entry point for creating and managing atomic swap reservations
2. **SettlementEscrow**: Holds collateral and manages settlement/refund logic
3. **DeskVault**: Underlying inventory management and collateral source
4. **Mailbox**: Encrypted communication channel for adaptor signature exchange
5. **CLSAG Adaptor**: Cryptographic protocol binding EVM and Monero transactions

### 2.2 Data Flow

1. **Reservation**: Maker creates atomic swap reservation, collateral moves to escrow
2. **Context Exchange**: Taker sends encrypted Monero context via mailbox
3. **Presignature**: Maker responds with encrypted CLSAG adaptor presignature
4. **Completion**: Taker completes signature and broadcasts Monero transaction
5. **Settlement**: Authorized party settles EVM side using revealed adaptor secret

## 3. Core Contracts

### 3.1 AtomicDesk Contract

The AtomicDesk contract serves as the primary interface for atomic swap operations.

#### Key Functions

```solidity
function registerDesk(address tokenA, address tokenB, bool baseIsA) 
    external returns (bytes32 deskId)
```
- Registers a new atomic desk for a token pair
- Requires the desk to be enabled in DeskVault
- Returns unique desk identifier

```solidity
function reserveAtomicSwap(
    bytes32 deskId,
    address taker,
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 settlementDigest,
    uint64 expiry
) external payable returns (uint256 reservationId)
```
- Creates a new atomic swap reservation
- Orchestrates collateral movement by depositing funds into DeskVault, reserving inventory, and instructing SettlementEscrow to pull the funds
- Enforces expiry window constraints
- Authorizes a communication slot in the Mailbox contract

```solidity
function setHashlock(uint256 reservationId, bytes32 hashlock) external
```
- Sets the hashlock (a commitment to the adaptor secret τ)
- Proxied to the SettlementEscrow contract, which stores the hashlock state
- Only callable by the desk maker
- Can only be set once per reservation

#### Access Control

- **Desk Registration**: Any address can register if DeskVault permits
- **Reservation Creation**: Only registered desk makers
- **Hashlock Setting**: Only the desk maker for that reservation

#### State Management

```solidity
struct DeskConfig {
    address maker;
    address tokenA;
    address tokenB;
    bool baseIsA;
    bool active;
}

struct ReservationMeta {
    bytes32 deskId;
    address asset;
    uint64 expiry;
    bool initialized;
    bool active;
}
```

### 3.2 SettlementEscrow Contract

Manages collateral holding and settlement logic. It is a protocol-wide component used by Atomic Desks and other system components like the Router.

#### Key Functions

```solidity
function reserve(
    address taker,
    address desk,
    address tokenA,
    address tokenB,
    bool baseIsA,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 settlementDigest,
    uint256 auctionId
) external returns (uint256 reservationId)
```
- Creates escrow reservation (called by AtomicDesk)
- Pulls collateral from DeskVault
- Authorizes mailbox slot

```solidity
function settle(uint256 reservationId, bytes32 tau) external
```
- Settles reservation by revealing adaptor secret
- Validates hashlock: `keccak256(tau) == hashlock`
- Transfers collateral to taker
- Only callable by desk maker or committee

```solidity
function refund(uint256 reservationId, bytes32 noSpendEvidence) external
```
- Emergency refund after safety window expires
- Only callable by committee members
- Returns collateral to maker via DeskVault

#### Security Model

- **Settlement Authority**: Restricted to desk maker or committee members
- **Hashlock Validation**: Cryptographic proof of Monero spend knowledge
- **Time Locks**: Safety window prevents premature refunds
- **Committee Oversight**: Multi-signature committee can intervene

### 3.3 DeskVault Integration

Atomic Desks integrate with the existing DeskVault system, which is a shared, protocol-wide component responsible for all inventory management.

#### Atomic Desk Flag

```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public atomicDeskEnabled;

function configureAtomicDesk(address tokenA, address tokenB, bool enabled) external
```
- Makers must explicitly enable atomic functionality
- Prevents accidental exposure to cross-chain risks
- Can be toggled on/off as needed

#### Collateral Flow

The collateral flow is a multi-step process orchestrated by AtomicDesk:

1. **Deposit (if needed)**: AtomicDesk can act as a trusted agent to deposit collateral into DeskVault on the maker's behalf using `depositAFor`/`depositBFor`. More commonly, the maker pre-funds their vault balance.
2. **Inventory Reservation**: AtomicDesk calls `DeskVault.reserveAtomicInventory()` to move funds from the maker's free balance to a reserved state.
3. **Escrow Pull**: AtomicDesk then calls `SettlementEscrow.reserve()`, which in turn calls `DeskVault.pullFromDeskForEscrow()` to pull the reserved funds into the SettlementEscrow contract.
4. **Settlement**: Upon successful settlement, the SettlementEscrow contract transfers the collateral directly to the taker.
5. **Refund**: In a refund scenario, SettlementEscrow calls `DeskVault.returnEscrowCollateral()` to return the funds to the maker's free balance in the vault.

---

## 4. Cryptographic Protocol

### 4.1 CLSAG Adaptor Signatures

The system uses CLSAG (Concise Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group) adaptor signatures to bind EVM and Monero transactions cryptographically.

#### Key Properties

- **Adaptor Secret (τ)**: Shared value that unlocks both transactions. τ is committed on-chain as a hashlock and becomes extractable from the completed signature; makers/committee should settle only after observing the Monero spend.
- **Hashlock**: `H(τ)` committed on EVM side before Monero spend
- **Signature Binding**: CLSAG signature mathematically linked to settlement digest
- **Privacy Preservation**: No Monero transaction details revealed on EVM

#### Protocol Flow

1. **Setup**: Maker chooses τ, commits `H(τ)` as hashlock
2. **Context**: Taker provides Monero transaction context (encrypted)
3. **Presignature**: Maker creates biased CLSAG signature with τ
4. **Completion**: Taker completes signature, broadcasts Monero transaction
5. **Extraction**: Anyone can extract τ from completed signature
6. **Settlement**: τ used to unlock EVM collateral

### 4.2 Settlement Digest Binding

```solidity
settlementDigest = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
    auctionId,
    deskId,
    quoteIn,
    baseOut,
    takerAddr,
    deskAddr,
    chainId
))
```

This digest ensures:
- Unique binding per swap
- Prevention of replay attacks
- Cross-chain context integrity
- Deterministic settlement verification

---

## 5. Communication Layer

### 5.1 Mailbox System

The Mailbox contract provides encrypted, authenticated communication between swap participants.

#### Message Types

1. **Context Message**: Taker → Desk (Monero transaction context)
2. **Presignature Message**: Desk → Taker (CLSAG adaptor presignature)  
3. **TxProof Message**: Taker → Desk (reservationId + Monero txid + optional metadata)

#### Encryption Scheme

- **Algorithm**: ChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Key Exchange**: Secp256k1 ECDH
- **Authentication**: AAD binding to reservation context
- **Replay Protection**: Per-reservation nonces

#### Authorization Model

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bool) internal slotAuthorized;

function authorizeReservation(uint256 reservationId) external
function revokeReservation(uint256 reservationId) external
```

- Slots authorized only during active reservations
- Automatic revocation on settlement/refund
- Prevents unauthorized message posting

### 5.2 Public Key Management

```solidity
function registerPubkey(bytes calldata pubkey) external
```

- Desks register secp256k1 public keys for encryption
- Keys validated on-chain for correctness
- Used for encrypting responses to desk makers

    M->>AD: registerDesk(tokenA, tokenB, baseIsA)
    M->>DV: configureAtomicDesk(tokenA, tokenB, true)
    M->>DV: depositA(tokenA, tokenB, amount)

    SE->>DV: pullFromDeskForEscrow(maker, tokenA, tokenB, baseIsA, amount)
    SE->>MB: authorizeReservation(reservationId)
    
    M->>AD: setHashlock(reservationId, H(τ))

    T->>XMR: broadcastTransaction(completedCLSAG)
    
    M->>SE: settle(reservationId, τ)
    SE-->>T: call{value: amount} for ETH (safeTransfer for ERC20)
```

### 6.2 Refund Path: Failed Swap

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Committee
    participant SE as SettlementEscrow
    participant DV as DeskVault
    participant M as Maker
    participant XMR as Monero Network

    Note over C: Wait for safety window
    C->>XMR: verifyNoSpend(expectedTxId)
    C->>SE: refund(reservationId, noSpendEvidence)
    SE->>DV: returnEscrowCollateral(maker, tokenA, tokenB, baseIsA, amount)
    SE-->>M: collateral returned to DeskVault
```

### 6.3 Error Handling

#### Timeout Scenarios
- **Expiry Before Settlement**: Reservation becomes eligible for refund
- **Safety Window**: Committee can refund after verifying no Monero spend
- **Mailbox Timeout**: Messages expire with reservation

#### Cryptographic Failures
- **Invalid Hashlock**: Settlement reverts if `H(τ) ≠ hashlock`
- **Signature Verification**: Off-chain validation before settlement
- **Extraction Mismatch**: Committee can verify τ consistency

#### Access Control Violations
- **Unauthorized Settlement**: Only desk maker or committee can settle
- **Invalid Reservations**: Strict validation of all parameters
- **Mailbox Authorization**: Messages rejected for unauthorized slots
